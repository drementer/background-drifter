   * ðŸŽ¨ PARALLAX MOUSE TRACKING EFFECT
   * ===============================================
   *
   * WHAT THIS DOES:
   * Creates a smooth parallax effect where the background image subtly moves
   * in the OPPOSITE direction of your mouse cursor. This creates a 3D-like
   * depth effect that makes the page feel more interactive and alive.
   *
   * HOW IT WORKS:
   * - Move mouse LEFT â†’ background moves RIGHT
   * - Move mouse RIGHT â†’ background moves LEFT
   * - Move mouse UP â†’ background moves DOWN
   * - Move mouse DOWN â†’ background moves UP
   * - Mouse in CENTER â†’ background stays STILL
   *
   * THE MATH BEHIND IT:
   * We need to convert mouse pixels into background movement distance.
   * This happens in 3 clear steps:
   *
   * Step 1: CENTERING (Make middle = zero)
   * Step 2: NORMALIZING (Scale to -1 and +1 range)
   * Step 3: SCALING (Apply real movement distance in vw/vh units)
   *
   * EXAMPLE: Mouse at right edge of 1920px screen
   * Step 1: 1920/1920 = 1.0 â†’ 1.0 - 0.5 = 0.5 (centered)
   * Step 2: 0.5 Ã— 2 = 1.0 (normalized to full range)
   * Step 3: 1.0 Ã— 75 = 75vw (final movement distance)
   * Result: Background moves 75vw to the LEFT (opposite direction)

    /**
     * STEP 1: CENTER THE MOUSE POSITION
     *
     * What we have: mouseXPercentage tells us how far the mouse is from the LEFT edge
     * - 0 = at the left edge (0% from left)
     * - 0.5 = in the center (50% from left)
     * - 1 = at the right edge (100% from left)
     *
     * What we want: Make the CENTER of screen = 0, so we can measure distance FROM center
     * - Left side should be negative (-)
     * - Center should be zero (0)
     * - Right side should be positive (+)
     *
     * Solution: Subtract 0.5 to shift the center point to zero
     *
     * Examples:
     * - Left edge: 0.0 - 0.5 = -0.5 (half distance left of center)
     * - Quarter point: 0.25 - 0.5 = -0.25 (quarter distance left of center)
     * - Center: 0.5 - 0.5 = 0 (exactly at center, no movement needed)
     * - Three-quarter: 0.75 - 0.5 = +0.25 (quarter distance right of center)
     * - Right edge: 1.0 - 0.5 = +0.5 (half distance right of center)
     *
     * Result: Now ranges from -0.5 to +0.5, with center = 0

     * STEP 2: EXPAND TO FULL MOVEMENT RANGE
     *
     * What we have: Distance from center is only -0.5 to +0.5 (half range)
     * - From center to edge = maximum 0.5 distance
     * - This gives us only HALF of the movement capability we want
     *
     * What we want: Full movement range from -1 to +1 (full diameter)
     * - We want the FULL movement capacity, not just half
     * - Think of it as expanding the "movement diameter" to use the entire range
     *
     * Solution: Multiply by 2 to convert half-range to full-range
     * - This converts our "radius" (0.5) into "diameter" (1.0)
     * - Now we can use the complete movement potential
     *
     * Examples:
     * - Left edge (-0.5): -0.5 Ã— 2 = -1.0 (maximum leftward movement)
     * - Quarter left (-0.25): -0.25 Ã— 2 = -0.5 (half leftward movement)
     * - Center (0): 0 Ã— 2 = 0 (no movement)
     * - Quarter right (+0.25): +0.25 Ã— 2 = +0.5 (half rightward movement)
     * - Right edge (+0.5): +0.5 Ã— 2 = +1.0 (maximum rightward movement)
