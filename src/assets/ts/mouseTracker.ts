/**
 * üñ±Ô∏è MOUSE TRACKER - Initial Position Detection
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * This module provides a way to get the initial mouse position when the page loads.
 * It's designed to be lightweight and only capture the position once, then clean up.
 *
 * WHY WE NEED THIS:
 * - On page load, we don't know where the mouse cursor is positioned
 * - We need this information for initial parallax effects or UI positioning
 * - Traditional mouse tracking is continuous and resource-intensive
 * - This gives us a one-time snapshot efficiently
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * 1. Creates a transparent overlay covering the entire viewport
 * 2. Listens for the first mouse/pointer event (mouseenter, mousemove, etc.)
 * 3. Captures the coordinates and immediately resolves the Promise
 * 4. Automatically cleans up the overlay and event listeners
 *
 * USAGE:
 * const position = await getInitialMousePosition();
 * console.log('Mouse at:', position.x, position.y);

   * - Prevents missing events if mouse is at screen edges
   * - Provides consistent behavior across different screen sizes
